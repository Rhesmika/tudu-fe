# Tudu - Front End

Tudu is a task management website where users can catagorise, track and update their tasks.Tudu hopes to help users to bring digital organisation to their lives. 

The goal is to ensure users can:
- Signup/Login and view data that only they can see
- View all their boards
- View all their tasks
- Create Boards
- Create Tasks (and have them assigned to the board)
- Edit their Board name
- Edit and update their Task details
- Delete Boards
- Delete Tasks

The React App ensures that the user approaches a functional and easy to use website which has a clean appearance and a clean process to track their task progress.

### Design 
The design of the front end needed to be uncomplicated, but punchy. This was reflected in the font and colour choices. I created the design for the general layout, logo and some icons in Adobe Illustrator.

I used Adobe Illustrator to put the mock-up together for this website. The layout of the page is intended to be very linear and clear. I created vector paperclips, the tudu log and the not found (I used an external image as a reference credited below). The Colours are intended to be clean and 'gender nutural'.

### Design Edits 
The design didn't include for features such as the search bars and dropdown menu which sort the tasks and boards. Becuase of this the styling was created outside of illustrator and directly on the front end.  
I did need to adjust the styling of the home page as this was overcomplicated for my abilities at this time.
